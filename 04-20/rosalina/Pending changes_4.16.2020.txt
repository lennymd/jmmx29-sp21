1. Linechart1 and Linechart2: 
x-axis labels - move down
2. Stacked bar chart: 
Fix legend [LMD: Make it bigger? Bring it closer? How do you want to modify?]
3. Maps:
fix space between text and map. [LMD: centering them would do wonders
4. ALL Bar charts:
LMD: are the ticks necessary?
5. General: Can we center all the charts?

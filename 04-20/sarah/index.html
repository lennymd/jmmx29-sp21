    <h1>Can we trust facial recognition?</h1>

    <p id="tagline">
      As facial recognition gains prominence with law enforcement, should
      Americans be asking how much we know about its accuracy and how its being
      used?
    </p>

    <div class="flex-container">
      <img
        class="flex-container-item purple-face-image"
        src="./img/FaceProfile.png"
      />

      <p class="flex-container-item">
        Artificial intelligence algorithms map your face and then converts the
        map into a mathematical equation that is compared to other faces in the
        available database. The computer resturns results that appear similar to
        the photo and gives a confidence score to show the liklihood that each
        result is accurate.
      </p>

      <div class="flex-container-item">
        <div class="face-match-div">
          <img class="face-match-image" src="./img/Ali.png" />
          <img class="face-match-image" src="./img/Lauren.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="face-match-div">
          <img class="face-match-image" src="./img/Sarah.png" />
          <img class="face-match-image" src="./img/Howie.png" />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Trust in facial recognition may stem from how results are shown</h2>
    <p>
      Often, facial recognition data shown to the public is from "best case
      scenario" situations, such as high-quality photo comparison, which is
      often not how the software is actually being used in the field.

    <h2>Despite dangerous levels of mis-identification</h2>

    <div class="flex-container-graphs">
      <p>
        <strong>False positive rate</strong> is the percentage of the time that
        the algorithm says someone is a match when they are not a match. False
        positives in a police context create
        <strong>suspects out of innocent people</strong>
      </p>

      <div id="chart_false_positives" class="centered-chart"></div>
    </div>

    <h2>False positive rates and how they work</h2>

    <p>
      Letâ€™s pretend there is a crime caught on tape at Yankee stadium. A picture
      of each person is taken at security as they leave the stadium for police
      to try to match with the tape. The Ayonix algorithm would place 118
      innocent people under suspicion with <strong>no evidence</strong>, even
      under ideal photo conditions.

    <h2>Facial recognition can be abused and misused by police</h2>

    <p>
      Despite concerns of accuracy, most states allow the state police, FBI, or
      both to run searches using the state drivers license photo database
      without a warrant or probable cause
    </p>

    <p class="yellow-standout">
      Nearly half of all U.S adults have their photo in at least one database
      searchable by the FBI without a warrant
    </p>

    <p id="yellow-number-standout">117,000,000</p>

    <p class="yellow-standout">
      This does not include other federal agencies, state police, local police,
      private security companies, or social media sites

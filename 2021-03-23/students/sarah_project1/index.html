  <h1>Can we trust facial <strong>recognition?</strong></h1>

  <p>As facial recognition gains prominence with law enforcement, should Americans be asking how much we know about its accuracy and how its being used?</p>

  <p>Artificial intelligence algorithms map your face and then converts the map into a mathematical equation that is compared to other faces in the available database. The computer resturns results that appear similar to the photo and gives a confidence score to show the liklihood that each result is accurate.</p>

  <h2>Trust in face recognition may stem from how results are shown</h2>

  <h2>Despite dangerous levels of mis-identification</h2>

  <!-- <div class= "infographic-placeholder">
  Chart of false positive rates per algorithm</div> -->

  <p><strong>False positive rate</strong> is the percentage of the time that the algorithm says someone is a match when they are not a match. False positives in a police context create <strong>suspects out of 
    innocent peoople</strong></p>

  <h2>False positive rates and how they work</h2>

  <p>Letâ€™s pretend there is a crime caught on tape at Yankee stadium. A picture of each person is taken at security as they leave the stadium for police to try to match with the tape.</p>

  </div> -->

  <p>The Ayonix algorithm would place 118 innocent people under suspicion with <strong>no evidence</strong>,  even under ideal photo conditions.</p> 

  <h2>Facial recognition can be abused and misused by police</h2>

  <p>Despite concerns of accuracy, most states allow the state police, FBI, or both to run searches using the state drivers license photo database without a warrant or probable cause</p>

  <p class="yellow-standout">Nearly half of all U.S
    adults have their photo in at least one database searchable by the FBI without a warrant</p>

  <p id="yellow-number-standout">117,000,000</p>

  <p class="yellow-standout">This does not include
  other federal agencies,
  state police, local police, private security companies, or social media sites<p>

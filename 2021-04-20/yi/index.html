      weight-loss diet,you may assume you need to keep away from nuts due to
      their high calories. Yes, nut contain rich mounts of fat and they can't
      burn fat, but no food can. You body use fat as energy only when the
      calories you need is more than the amount you consume. It seems nut can
      increase your waistline easily. However, the fact is probably contray to
      your assumption if you just eat a proper serving of nuts.

          Nuts may aid in loosing weight. Nuts are high in fiber, protein and
          unsaturated fat, but low in sugar. The fact is, even a small number of
          nuts can make you feel full. Researchersâ€™ findings show that people
          can take proper amounts of nuts without gaining pounds, so nuts are
          helpful in maintaining a healthy weight. The following charts
          illustrate the amount of the four ingredients in various nuts.

        Foods high in fiber can make you feel full longer after eating and help
        you consume less calories.Nuts contain high amouts of insoluble fiber
        which is hard to digest, so it passes quickly through your digestive
        system. However, US citizens eat limited fiber everyday and the amout is
        far from enough. The scale below indicates the difference between actual
        concumption and recommonded consomption

      <p class="paragraph1">
        Saturated fat is not healthy. It primarily comes from animal products,
        such as butter and lard. Studies have shown that consuming hight amout
        of satuarted fat may increase the risk of heart disease
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph1">
        While unsaturated fat is good fat, which mainly from vegetables, nuts
        and seeds. It consists of Monounsaturate fat and polyunsaturated fat.
        Using Unsaturated fat to replace saturated fat in the diet could lower
        the cholesterol level and reduce resk of heart disease.

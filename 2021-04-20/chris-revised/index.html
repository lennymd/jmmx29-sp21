      <h2>HOW AMERICANS SPEND THEIR TIME</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to how Americans are choosing to spend their time, it’s
        clear that exercise is not a priority. In fact, the average American
        spend less than 20 minutes exercising each day, nearly ten times the
        amount of time they watch TV each day. Though not all Americans
        participate in each activity each day (the unemployed, for instance),
        the chart below shows how the average American spends their day.

      <h2>LOOKING AHEAD TO THE FUTURE</h2>
      <p>
        So does the future look as bleak as the present? The good news is that
        thing are trending upward. All adult age groups have seen significant
        growth in exercise rates, as measured by the percentage of adults who
        meet CDC guidelines for daily exercise (at least a 1 hour per day of
        moderate-intensity aerobic exercise).

        <h2>WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON EXERCISES?</h2>
        <p>
          While it’s no surprise that walking is the most common exercise, it is
          interesting that each of the top 5 are traditionally known as
          individual sports. Given the Impact of COVID-19 and closure of gyms,
          we may see a surge in home cardio equipment in the next year.

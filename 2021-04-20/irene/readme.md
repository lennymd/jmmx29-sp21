Things to do asap

~~1. Treechart: aka treemap is not connecting on main index.html (there is a blank space but nothing shows up) so I made a "Treechart Trial" folder to just try the chart by itself and it seems like the thing that is impacting the connection is my data.~~ <br>
a. adjust labels so that the reader can see them <br>
b. make map squares different colors using color function from the bars.js <br> 2. Scatterplot Next Steps: <br>
~~a. Add "ethnicity" groups to data. Add "ethnicity" to label line so that it shows up as a label.~~ <br>
b. Create functions so that only some of the labels show up on the dots, not all. Use function from barchart.js where AA bar is red to create a function for the text above the dots.<br>
~~Edit tool tip so that it includes ethnicity.~~ <br>
c. Edit tool tip so that border is removed and background color is light teal color. --> could not do this directly on the js file for some reason--> line 57 on index.html in income scatterplot folder<br>
d. Create function so that only some of the circles are different colors.<br>
e. Edit tick marks by finding class of tick marks and make them white. Extend them so that they go through the whole chart. Only include some of the tick marks, not all. Change background color of SVG to light yellow. on it's own page, everything works and data connects. I want to know how to add annotations right on the bubbles vs. the hover state. And also to style like where the bubbles are different colors like on my original chart.<br>
d. Connect scatterplot to index.html.<br>
~~3. Make the "Asian American" bars on both bar charts a different color. I think there would have to be a function that selects the Asian American bars as the highest values and then changes that color, but not sure how to do this because bar colors are coded in css and not javascript.~~ <br>
3a. Don't know why text labels don't show up on Annual Household income bar chart...<br> 3. Scatterplot: use inspector on go live to find the class of the tick marks and the x axis line. create a class on css file and make - display=none to make it disappear

Things to do later

1. Put the two bar charts next to each other and the pie charts underneath. Pie charts will be one straight line.
2. Make the bar charts and pie charts responsive so that when a user looks at it on mobile, the charts line up in one column vertically.

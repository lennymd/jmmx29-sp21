TODO

1. Add in missing images. I commented them out for now.
2. Make grid scaffolding more readable (white or grey might be good colors).
3. Add a general Legend before the charts since the colors don't seem to change by country. This helps you remove the text on the right of chart and it lets you make the charts wider!
4. Add a title to the page (look for the `<title></title>` tags)
5. You made the digital version, be sure to add your name to the byline too

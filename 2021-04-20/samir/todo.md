TODO

1. Spruce up the CSS
2. For your "WHAT COLOR CAR GETS TICKETED THE MOST?" section, can you lay things out so all the cars are next to each other? That helps us better compare the relative sizes.
3. Will you add the map?
4. I think keeping the 3 dot plots as simple as possible makes a bit more sense stylistically.

    <p><div id="gnrlbdytxt">Before the new anti-immigration laws were enacted, the number of undocumented immigrants were less as the majority of undocumented immigrants from Mexico used to travel between the US and Mexico. With the stringent crackdown initiated by the current administration, the number of undocumented immigrants entering US increased as they preferred to stay out in the US rather than risk crossing the US- Mexico border out of fear of being prosecuted and eventual deportation, as mandated by the new anti-immigration laws.</div><br></p>

    <p><div id="gnrlbdytxt">The stringent immigration crackdown initiated by the various administrations have resulted in a tremendous increase in the number of immigrants that have been apprehended by the US Border patrol at the US- Mexico border. The current administration has emphasized that all immigrants crossing the border must be separated from the family, even minor children and sent to the detention centers located all over the country in order to ease the burden at the border detention facilities. Typically, many undocumented immigrants cross over the border as families along with single adults and minor unaccompanied children making up the numbers over the years. The administration believes that separating the families including minor children and shipping them across different detention centers all over the country will serve as a strong deterrence. Thus, detention centers all over the country are housing immigrants detained at the southwest border</div></p>

    <h2><div id="header4">Profit & Abuses</div></h2>
    <div class="Grid_Container3">
      <div class="Box1">
        <p><div id="gnrlbdytxt">The various administrations have prioritized the capture and eventual deportation of the undocumented immigrants. This initiative has created the need for increased prisons and detention centers to process and hold the undocumented immigrants until they are eventually deported. Thus, the authorities have started awarding contracts to private, for-profit providers of prison services to house more immigrants. The accompanying graphic shows the increased spending allocated to many private for- profit operators in the country. Needless to say, the detention of undocumented immigrants has become a profitable business and there are fears that many for- profit contractors are increasingly bidding to establish such prisons to meet the demands of the present administration. As a result, the government has increased the allocation of the tax payerâ€™s money towards initiatives such as for- profit, private prisons which is a wasteful enterprise as it does nothing to solve the problem at hand- the issue of undocumented immigrants and how to deal with them in an ethical, humane manner. The law enforcement can use this money to focus their efforts to curb violent crimes which will be beneficial to citizens.</div></p>

      <div class="Box2">
                <p><div id="gnrlbdytxt">Yet another cause for concern about the unchecked proliferation of the private prisons is that these for- profit prisons have a substantially high number of human rights abuse cases of the detainees. It is pretty obvious that such privately run prisons prioritize profits above all else at the cost of human rights and basic dignity that every human being is entitled to, undocumented immigrant or not. Apart from being grossly amoral, such violations ruin the image of the United States as a nation that champions democracy, human rights and freedom. Additionally, proliferation of such for- private prisons is financially ruinous as they siphon off funds that could be utilized better for initiatives such as overhauling the immigration and border security issues. More humane ways can be adopted for ensuring immigration compliance.</div></p>

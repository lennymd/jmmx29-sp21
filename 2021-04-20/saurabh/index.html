          Before the new anti-immigration laws were enacted, the number of
          undocumented immigrants were less as the majority of undocumented
          immigrants from Mexico used to travel between the US and Mexico. With
          the stringent crackdown initiated by the current administration, the
          number of undocumented immigrants entering US increased as they
          preferred to stay out in the US rather than risk crossing the US-
          Mexico border out of fear of being prosecuted and eventual
          deportation, as mandated by the new anti-immigration laws.

      The stringent immigration crackdown initiated by the various
      administrations have resulted in a tremendous increase in the number of
      immigrants that have been apprehended by the US Border patrol at the US-
      Mexico border. The current administration has emphasized that all
      immigrants crossing the border must be separated from the family, even
      minor children and sent to the detention centers located all over the
      country in order to ease the burden at the border detention facilities.
      Typically, many undocumented immigrants cross over the border as families
      along with single adults and minor unaccompanied children making up the
      numbers over the years. The administration believes that separating the
      families including minor children and shipping them across different
      detention centers all over the country will serve as a strong deterrence.
      Thus, detention centers all over the country are housing immigrants
      detained at the southwest border

    <h2 id="header4">Profit & Abuses</h2>

        <p>
          The various administrations have prioritized the capture and eventual
          deportation of the undocumented immigrants. This initiative has
          created the need for increased prisons and detention centers to
          process and hold the undocumented immigrants until they are eventually
          deported. Thus, the authorities have started awarding contracts to
          private, for-profit providers of prison services to house more
          immigrants. The accompanying graphic shows the increased spending
          allocated to many private for- profit operators in the country.
          Needless to say, the detention of undocumented immigrants has become a
          profitable business and there are fears that many for- profit
          contractors are increasingly bidding to establish such prisons to meet
          the demands of the present administration. As a result, the government
          has increased the allocation of the tax payerâ€™s money towards
          initiatives such as for- profit, private prisons which is a wasteful
          enterprise as it does nothing to solve the problem at hand- the issue
          of undocumented immigrants and how to deal with them in an ethical,
          humane manner. The law enforcement can use this money to focus their
          efforts to curb violent crimes which will be beneficial to citizens.

          Yet another cause for concern about the unchecked proliferation of the
          private prisons is that these for- profit prisons have a substantially
          high number of human rights abuse cases of the detainees. It is pretty
          obvious that such privately run prisons prioritize profits above all
          else at the cost of human rights and basic dignity that every human
          being is entitled to, undocumented immigrant or not. Apart from being
          grossly amoral, such violations ruin the image of the United States as
          a nation that champions democracy, human rights and freedom.
          Additionally, proliferation of such for- private prisons is
          financially ruinous as they siphon off funds that could be utilized
          better for initiatives such as overhauling the immigration and border
          security issues. More humane ways can be adopted for ensuring
          immigration compliance.

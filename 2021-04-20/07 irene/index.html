    <h3>Asians, On Average</h3>
    <p class="pparagraphs">
      The “smart and quiet” stereotype of the Asian American student has rung
      familiar in classrooms and pop culture throughout the United States for
      decades. Coined the “model minority,” Asian Americans collectively score
      higher on standardized tests and attain bachelor’s degrees at higher rates
      than other racial groups. Additionally, they seemingly achieve the
      “American Dream” with the highest median annual income by race. Below are
      the statistics of Asian American achievement shown as an aggregate.

    <h3>Asians Are Not All The Same: Disaggregating Data</h3>
    <p class="pparagraphs">
      On the surface, it may seem compelling to believe that if, “Asians can
      achieve, other minorities can too,” However, the “Asian” race includes
      over 28 ethnic groups who have immigrated from East Asia, South Asia,
      Southeast Asia, and Pacific Islands. When disaggregating the data by
      ethnic group, it becomes apparent that Laotian, Bhutanese, and Hmong
      groups have lower income and education levels than the national average
      due to immigration policies and patterns. The myth that all Asian groups
      are smarter and wealthier than the average American makes it challenging
      for low-income ethnic groups to gain access to financial and social
      services.

      <h3>The Effect on Black Americans and Civil Rights</h3>
      <p class="pparagraphs">
        The model minority myth perpetuates racism and anti-blackness in
        insidious ways. Historically, the combined effects of immigration
        policies, biased storytelling, and sensationalized media coverage
        perpetuate the racist stereotype. The stereotype has been exploited by
        the government and media to intentionally discredit the black civil
        rights movement.

    <h3>The Racial Triangulation of Asian Americans</h3>
    <p class="pparagraphs">
      In her 1999 article, “The Racial Triangulation of Asian Americans,” Claire
      Jean Kim offers a “Field of Racial Positions” as a way to understand how
      stereotypes of Asian Americans uphold white hegemony. The Field allows
      readers to compare White, Black, and Asian American racial groups. The Y
      axis represents relative superioirity, while the X axis represents to what
      extent the group is considered an “insider.”

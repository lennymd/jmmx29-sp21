To Do's

-Top header readjust again
-create 2-column grid or an aside for top image and text
-Top right image needs caption/annotation added

Heatmap: 
-stack and column center titles at the top (found this but having trouble integrating: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7555321) (couldn't figure out how to add dx dy to only one title-they are a group)
-Maybe add long tic mark across the y axis
-Maybe change gray rectangles to white with gray stroke without adding a stroke to the other color rectangles  similar to print piece (trying to figure this out - so far I've only been able to add the stroke to all the rectangle svgs)

Pie chart:
-create grid container? Not sure it really needs it. I like how it is responsive right now
-the main percentages when below 50% are to the left of the chart, but I would like all pink percentages to the right like the first three pie charts

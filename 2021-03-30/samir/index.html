        <h1>What makes you more likely <br> to get a ticket?</h1>

        <p class="columns">There are millions of traffic tickets issued every year in the United States, largely to
            ensure lawfulness on the road. Without the threat of a large fee or a court order, there would be many
            drivers who would drive recklessly and at the expense of others. This is the benefit of traffic tickets;
            they make people more prone to driving carefully and attentively. There are many
            reasons by which a police officer may issue someone a ticket, and thus there are patterns associated with
            the issuance of tickets (i.e., by color of car, race, gender, age, etc.). This graphic is intended to
            illustrate and explore these patterns.

        <h2> What color car gets ticketed the most?</h2>
        <p class="subsection_text">The illustrations below take a look at the colors of cars that get ticketed the most
            frequently relative to the <br>number of these color cars on the road.

        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sXKnD80V/dark-gray-car.png" class="gray_car">
        <p class="gray_car_text">While they only constitute <strong>6%</strong> of cars of total, solid gray cars
            account for <strong>10%</strong> of tickets. In other words, for every solid gray car on the road, about
            <strong>1.67</strong> of them get a ticket!
        </p>

        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/k5JhSKRM/red-car.png" class="red_car">
        <p class="red_car_text">While the stigma is that red cars get pulled over the most, the data says otherwise.
            They make up about <strong>14%</strong> of cars on the road, yet account for <strong>16%</strong> of
            tickets. This is a ratio of about <strong>1.142</strong>.</p>

        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/6QFnKNKs/white-car.png" class="white_car">
        <p class="white_car_text">White cars account for most of the total cars on the road at about
            <strong>25%</strong>. However, they receive only <strong>19%</strong> of tickets. This is a ratio of about
            <strong>0.76</strong> tickets per white car on the road.
        </p>

        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/QtxGjvJb/silver-car.png" class="silver_car">
        <p class="silver_car_text">Making up about <strong>10%</strong> of cars on the road, silver cars account for
            <strong>5%</strong> of tickets. This means that for every silver car on the road, only <strong>half</strong>
            of them tend to get a ticket.

          <h1>Wealth and Prison</h1>
          <p class="author">Rafael de la Zerda</p>
          <p>
            When you’re jailed, money can make all the difference. In the United
            States, income has a significant impact on the experience of
            incarceration at every stage, interplaying with race and gender. The
            county’s infamously large prison population is largely due to its
            excessive bail, which restricts the principle of innocent until
            proven guilty to the wealthy. Moreover, those in lower income
            brackets are more likely to be jailed to begin with, and most of
            those unable to meet bail fall within the poorest third of society.
            A greater percentage of men than women unable to make bail are
            moderately wealthy, while women unable to make bail are evenly
            distributed across all economic brackets. The likelihood of
            incarceration is higher for blacks than for whites and Hispanics at
            every level of wealth. Racial wealth gaps have been observed among
            the future-incarcerated and the previously-incarcerated. The rate of
            unemployment is higher for those released from prison than for the
            general population. The rates are highest for black women and lowest
            for white men.

        <h2>Prison Income Distributions by Gender</h2>
        <div id="linechart"></div>
        <p>
          Monthly income categories for jailed individuals ages 23-39 prior to
          incarceration, for the incarcerated unable to meet bail, and for the
          non-incarcerated. Amounts are expressed in 2002 dollars. Men unable to
          make bail skewed toward higher salaries, likely due to higher overall
          income; women unable to make bail were more evenly distributed across
          categories. Though most jailed individuals make less than the
          non-incarcerated in their income bracket, there is a notable
          exception: more women making $0 were never incarcerated than those who
          were. One explanation is that many non-incarcerated women relied on
          their spouses.

            Median annual incomes, prior to incarceration, for those aged 23-39
            unable to meet bail in local jails, expressed in 2015 dollars. The
            median bail bond is nearly equivalent to a full year’s income for
            those unable to meet bail, on a national level. The median
            pre-incarceration income was $15,109, less than half the median for
            those not in jail of similar ages.

        <p>
          Unemployment rates of the formerly incarcerated compared to the
          general population, both ages 35-44. Results are broken down by age
          and gender. Rates were highest among blacks between both genders, in
          women between both races, and in the fomerly incarcer- ated across all
          categories.

        <h2>Wealth Distribution of Previously<br />and Never Incarcerated</h2>
        <div id="barchart2"></div>
        <p>
          Annual income distribution of the previously and never incarcerated
          across the 4 quartiles of wealth, broken down by race. Data are from
          the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, recorded across three
          nonconsecutive years. Greater wealth observed lower incarceration
          rates. At every economic level, each race had higher incomes if they
          had never been incarcerated. Whites had the greatest wealth in every
          category, blacks generally the least.

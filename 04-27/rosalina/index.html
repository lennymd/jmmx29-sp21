    <h1>GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT</h1>

    <h2>Is Pre-trial Detention Worsening USAâ€™s Prison Crisis?</h2>

    <p>
      The United States of America incarcerates more people than any other
      country in the world. Although the number of people in prisons and jails
      across the country has declined in the last 10 years, the average
      incarceration rate was still high at 437 per 100,000 people. A large
      proportion of the prison population is made up of pre-trial detainees,
      that is, people who have been arrested but not yet been convicted of any
      crime. As of 2018, over 490,000 people were being held in pre-trial
      detention in local jails, totaling 66% of the jail population.

    <h4>POPULATION HELD IN ALL PRISON FACILITIES HAS INCREASED</h4>
    <p>
      Majority of the incarcerated population are housed in state prisons and
      local jails.

    <h4>BAIL AMOUNTS BY TYPE OF OFFENSE</h4>
    <p>
      Most detainees are too poor to afford bail. Nationally, 34% of defendants
      were detained pretrial for the inability to post money bail (2009 data).

      <div id="barchart_2"></div>

    <p>
      <strong>
        PRE-TRIAL DETENTION COSTS THE PRISON SYSTEM $13.6 BILLION ANNUALLY
      </strong>
      and is the primary driver of overcrowding in jails. Research shows that
      pre-trial detainees, compared to their counterparts who are not detained,
      are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>25%</b> more likely to plead guilty</li>
      <li><b>43%</b> more likely to get convicted</li>
      <li>Receive <b>2x</b> longer longer jail sentences, on average</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Pre-trial detention can lead to downstream consequences such as job,
      income, and housing loss, separation of families, and increased likelihood
      to commit crimes again.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h4>HOW CAN WE MAKE THINGS BETTER?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ensure data transperancy and updates to outdated data sources at the
        local jurisdiction level to allow for robust analysis and
        decision-making
      </li>

      <li>
        Changes to how crimes are classified and prosecuted, with a special
        focus on alternatives to pre-trial detention for low-level felonies and
        misdemeanors
      </li>

      <li>
        Bail reform to reduce or eliminate use of bail, which disproportionately
        affects low-income groups and exacerbates racial inequities
      </li>

      <li>
        Programs focused on employment, housing, and physical and mental health
        to reduce the hardships caused by pre-trial detention stigma
      </li>
    </ul>

Things to do asap

1. Treechart: aka treemap is not connecting on main index.html (there is a blank space but nothing shows up) so I made a "Treechart Trial" folder to just try the chart by itself and it seems like the thing that is impacting the connection is my data.
2. Scatterplot: have not connected to main index.html file yet. Data connects. But I want to know how to add annotations right on the bubbles vs. the hover state. And also to style like where the bubbles are different colors like on my original chart.
3. Make the "Asian American" bars on both bar charts a different color.

Things to do later

1. Put the two bar charts next to each other and the pie charts underneath. Pie charts will be one straight line.
2. Make the bar charts and pie charts responsive so that when a user looks at it on mobile, the charts line up in one column vertically.

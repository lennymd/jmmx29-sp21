Pie chart issues:

-the pie charts seem to be all connected as one unit. needs padding between each. If I remove the titles, all but the first chart disappear. 
-if I try to move the titles down, they all disappear
-I think I need to add them into a grid - but I rewated last weeks tutorial through the pie chart part and think I must have missed something with all my going back and forth of the video
-need to move the percentages to the center and restyle them (bigger and blue)
-the main percentages when below 50% are to the left of the chart, but I want them all to the right like the first three pie charts

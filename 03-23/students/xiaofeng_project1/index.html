  <h1>Uncomfortable Truths about Chinese Women</h1>
  
  <h2>How many difficulties will Chinese girls encounter in their lives?</h2>
  
  <h5>By Xiaofeng Jia</h5>
  
  <p>The traditional biases against women are evident in Chinese society today. Deeply entrenched social habits and customs that mitigate against gender equality are the major cause of the continuing violence against women in China, especially in the rural areas. Not only the domestic violence issue, the Chinese female is more difficult to accept higher education than male. They also need to pay much more time than male on child rearing and educating, which means they sacrificed their time on improving themselves and entertainment.</p>

  <p>Preference of sons can be explained by an attitude: a belief that boys have more value than girls; it can be defined as a gender bias as well.</p>
  
  <p>China used to have one child policy, but people can have their sencond or third child now. If a family is allowed to have two children, majority of families will choose to let the first child be born naturally, but when they have a second child, they will consider the issue of gender selection.</p>

  <p><strong>*This sex ratio shows that countless female babies are disappear before they are born in China.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Now the government already encourage the Chinese family to have the third child, which can reduce the financial pressure of the government. However, this policy will increase the gender imbanlance and trigger a series uncomfortable outcomes towards Chinese female.</p>
